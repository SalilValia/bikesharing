There was over 2.3 million rides in the month of August. 81 percent of the riders were susbribers to citibike. About 65 percent of the riders were male. 
The age range of riders varied but it seems the younger users tend to use the bike more.

These next visuals shows trips per weekday per hour. As it shows, peak hours were happening between the hours of 6-9 am and in the evening at 4-7pm on weekdays. Im assuming that is the time users use the bike-sharing in order to travel to and from work. From the gender aspect of the visual, it shower majority of the users were male at those times.
